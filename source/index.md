# AccuRanker Partner API

Welcome to the AccuRanker Partner API. You can use our API to get search results for
the keywords you post to it.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

If you want to experiment with the API, you can perform live requests from our
[API console](https://apigee.com/accuranker/embed/console/accuranker).

# Authentication

> If the auth_token is not included in the call, you will receive an error like this:

```json
{
    "title": "Missing parameter",
    "description": "The \"auth_token\" parameter is required."
}
```

> If the auth_token is invalid, you will receive an error like this:

```json
{
    "title": "Invalid auth_token",
    "description": "Please check that your authentication token is correct"
}
```

AccuRanker uses API keys to allow access to the API.

The API key must be included in all API requests. Add it as a parameter to the URL
being requested. For instance:

`/status?auth_token=your-auth-token`

The `auth_token` parameter is left out of the examples on this page. You must always include it. If missing you will receive an error like:

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>your-auth-token</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Rate Limiting

> If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive an error like this:

```json
{
    "title": "Rate limit",
    "description": "You have hit the rate limit of your requests"
}
```

To ensure stability of the system, all accounts have rate limits in place.
The starting rate limits are 1000 `POST`s and 2000 `GET`s per hour.

Calls to certain endpoints does not impact your limits. You can use the status
endpoint to view your current limits without impacting your current limit.

Your current limits are returned as headers in the response:

`X-RateLimit-Limit` - Your maximum hourly limit.

`X-RateLimit-Remaining` - Remaining hourly limit.

Please contact us if you need the limits raised.

# Account Status

## Get Account Status

curl "http://api.accuranker.com/status"

            "get": 2000,
            "post": 1000
        },
        "get": 2000,
        "post": 1000

If you want to perform a default desktop search, simply leaving both `mobile`
and `tablet` blank or set to false.

the callback URL. It will allow you to inspect the callback.
